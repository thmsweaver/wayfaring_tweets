#Wayfaring Tweets

##Overview
[Wayfaring Tweets](http://glacial-hollows-6244.herokuapp.com/ "Wayfaring Tweets") is a Rails app that allows users to retrieve an array of geo-tagged tweets of a chosen hashtag to be overlayed onto a gorgeous [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/ "Leaflet") map. The project was initially intended to allow users to recount roadtrips, but has potential for multiple use cases. Wayfaring Tweets was developed over a 5-day sprint as my final project for [General Assembly's WDI program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive "General Assembly's WDI program"), and was inspired by my love of maps and telling stories.
